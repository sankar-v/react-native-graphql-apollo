# react-native-graphql-apollo
Rewriting an existing react native graphql apollo implementation using the latest features of hooks in both Apollo and ReactJS and use of the latest version of React Navigation It is fun migrating the existing old react native application based on react navigation v3 (to latest v5), using the v3 features of Apollo GraphQL client like useQuery, useMutation etc., and using the latest features like useXXXX hooks of v16+ of ReactJS is a real learning exercise.

The project aims at accomplishing this migration in a smooth and non intrusive way and highlights the ease of use of the latest features offered by the frameworks used. Suffice to say, the newer features are easy to adopt and immplmenet once you get into the grove.

Happy programming!!
